Tools to manipulate pdf files.

Things they can do:
- Edit all the bookmarks of a pdf in a text editor
- Break a pdf file to multiple based on bookmarks



*Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.*

*I use those regular, but they have their quirks, may broke and maybe superseded by other tools.*
